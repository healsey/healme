It is quite a challenge for individuals with chronic health conditions to maintain a proper diet. HealthMe allows individuals to have the proper diet from over 2 million recipes. For example, it can feel quite debilitating to have diabetes because the individual feels like he/she is banned from eating most of the food that they usually consume.  HealthMe will give those individuals access to millions of recipes that will satisfy their health need while keeping them satiated.  

- HealthMe filters recipes by:
  1. Health condition
  2. Allergies
  3. Diet restrictions and much more...
